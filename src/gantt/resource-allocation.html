        In this example, you can see how to allocate single or multiple resources for the task. Based on the task complexity and the resource availability, you can plan and allocate the resources to task in the project. In this demo, there is a set of predefined resources and those IDs are assigned to the task. Resource information can be shown in Gantt chart by using the <code>labelSettings</code> property.
