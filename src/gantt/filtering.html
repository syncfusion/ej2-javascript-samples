        The filtering feature enables the user to view reduced amount of records based on filter criteria. The column
        menu filtering can be enabled by setting <code>allowFiltering</code> property as <code>true</code> and toolbar
        search box can be enabled by including the search item in the <code>toolbar</code> property.

            not have any child record then only the filtered records are displayed.</li>
