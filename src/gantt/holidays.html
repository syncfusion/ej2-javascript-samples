        In this example,<code> holidays </code> are displayed with vertical bar with the desired text using the <code>label</code> property. You can also mention the continuous holidays by specifying the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> range. For single holiday, you can define from value alone. Holidays are defined as an array of object collection, so that we can display more than one holiday in the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can even assign the <code>cssClass</code> to each holiday to change the default color of label and background.
