        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the histogram type charts.
        Histogram type charts can provide a visual display of large amounts of data that are difficult to understand in a tabular or spreadsheet form.
        You can use the <code>border</code> and <code>fill</code> properties to customize the vertical rect.
        The <code>dataLabel</code> property is used to represent individual data and its value.

        Tooltip is enabled in this example.
