        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the spline area type charts. This is similar to line type series, but the area will be closed and filled with series color. 
        You can use <code>border</code> and <code>fill</code> properties to customize the area. <code>marker</code> and <code>dataLabel</code> properties are used to represent individual data and its value. 
        Legend is enabled in this example with series type shape.
