        In this example, you can see how to render and configure inversed spline type charts using the
        <code>isTransposed</code> property. A spline chart uses a curved line to connect points in a data series.
        <code>Markers</code> are used to represent individual data points and their values.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see a tooltip in action, hover over or tap on the chart.
