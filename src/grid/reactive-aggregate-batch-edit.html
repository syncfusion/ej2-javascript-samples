    <p>This sample demonstrates reactive aggregate update on data change functionality of the Grid. In this sample, the

    <p>The Grid supports aggregates which will be displayed at the footer, group footer and group caption of the Grid.
        The aggregate configurations can be provided by the <code><a aria-label="API link for documentation" target="_blank" class="code"

        In this demo, the batch editing is enabled and the corresponding aggregate values will be refreshed when
        <strong><i>Freight</i></strong> cell value is changed.

        By default, reactive aggregate update is not supported by inline and dialog edit modes. But, we can refresh
        aggregates manually. Please refer to the <a aria-label="API link for documentation" target="_blank"
