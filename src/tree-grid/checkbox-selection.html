        TreeGrid mutliple selection can be achieved with the help of checkbox in each row. To render checkbox in each treegrid row, you need
        to define column type as <code>checkbox</code> using <code>columns->type</code> property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selection can be persisted on all the operations using
        <code>selectionSettings-> persistSelection</code> property. For persisting selection on the TreeGrid, any one of the column should be defined as a
        primary key using
        <code>columns->isPrimaryKey</code> property.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this demo, TreeGrid mutliple selection has been enabled with the selection persistance.
    </p>

        More information on the TreeGrid instantiation can be found in
        documentation section.
