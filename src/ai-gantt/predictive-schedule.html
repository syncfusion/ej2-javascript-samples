    <p>This sample demonstrates the predictive scheduling feature in the Syncfusion JavaScript Gantt Chart. It showcases
        how
        AI is utilized to forecast and schedule tasks based on historical data. The Gantt Chart displays taskbars with
        baselines, representing both the predicted schedule and the actual task timelines. The AI-driven prediction uses
        five years of historical task data alongside the current year's tasks to generate a comprehensive and accurate
        schedule, allowing users to visualize potential project timelines and adjust accordingly.

        This action predicts and generates a task schedule by analyzing five years of historical <strong>TaskCollection</strong> data
        along with the current year's <strong>TaskCollection</strong>. The AI model processes this data to forecast future tasks,
        creating a predictive task collection. This collection is then visualized on the Gantt Chart, with baselines
        indicating the predicted start and end dates of each task, allowing users to compare the projected schedule with
        the actual progress.
