    <p>This demo depicts the way to show or hide the weekend days of a week on Schedule. The days whichever not specified in

        In this demo, the
        <code>showWeekend</code> property is used either to show or hide the weekend days of a week and it is not applicable on
        <code>workweek</code> view. By default, it is set to
        <code>true</code>. The days which are not a part of the working days collection of a Schedule are usually considered as weekend days
        here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, the working days are defined as
        <code>[1, 3, 4, 5]</code> on Schedule. Therefore, the remaining days (0, 2, 6 â€“ Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday) are considered as weekend days
        and will be hidden from the views as the
        <code>showWeekend</code> property is set to false.
    </p>
