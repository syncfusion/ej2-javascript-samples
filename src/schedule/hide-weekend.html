        This demo depicts the way to show or hide the weekend days of a week on Scheduler. The days whichever not
        specified in working days collections will be taken into consideration as weekend days.

        In this demo, the <code>showWeekend</code> property is used either to show or hide the weekend days of a
        week and it is not applicable on <code>WorkWeek</code> view. By default, it is set to <code>true</code>.
        The days which are not a part of the working days collection of a Scheduler are usually considered as
        weekend days here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, the working days are defined as <code>[1, 3, 4, 5]</code> on Scheduler. Therefore, the remaining days
        (0, 2, 6 – Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday) are considered as weekend days and will be hidden from the views
        as the <code>showWeekend</code> property is set to false.
    </p>
