        This example demonstrates how to export the Scheduler events to an Excel file format at client-side.
    </p>

<div id="description">
    <p>
        In this example, the Scheduler events data are exported to an Excel file by making use of the public method
        <code>exportToExcel</code>. By default, the whole event collection bound to the Scheduler gets exported as an
        excel file. To export only specific events of Scheduler, you need to pass the custom data collection as a
        parameter to the <code>exportToExcel</code> method. This method accepts the export options as its arguments
        such as fileName, exportType, fields, customData, and includeOccurrences. The fileName denotes the name to be
        given for the exported file and the <code>exportType</code> allows you to set the format of the excel file to
        be exported either as .xlsx or .csv. The custom or specific field collection of event dataSource to be
        exported can be provided through <code>fieldsInfo</code> option and the custom data collection can be exported
        by passing them through the <code>customData</code> option. There also exists option to export individual
        instances of the recurring events to an excel file, by setting true or false to the
        <code>includeOccurrences</code> option, denoting either to include or exclude the occurrences as separate
        instances on an exported excel file.

        <strong>Module Injection</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To start using Excel exporting functionality in Scheduler, you need to import the <code>ExcelExport</code>
        module from <code>@syncfusion/ej2-schedule</code> package and then inject it using the
        <code>Schedule.Inject(ExcelExport)</code> method.
