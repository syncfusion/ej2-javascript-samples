        This example showcases how the work-cells of Scheduler auto-adjust its height based on the number of
        appointments present in those time ranges.

<div id="description">
    <p>
        In this example, <code>enableAdaptiveRows</code> property is set as <code>true</code> to auto-adjust the height
        of work cells based
        on the number of appointments present in the same time ranges. Also, this functionality is applicable only on
        all the timeline views as well as on the calendar month view. When this option is disabled, the height of the
        work cells remains static and at the time of exceeding appointments count, the <code>+n more</code> text
        indicator will be shown at the bottom of the cells.
