        In this demo, the working days of a week can be set on Scheduler using the <code>workDays</code> property
        which accepts the collection of day indexes (from 0 to 6) of a week. By default, it is set to
        <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> and in this demo, it has been set to <code>[1, 3, 5]</code> which means that
        <code>Monday, Wednesday, Friday</code> is being set as working days of a week and is visually differentiated
        from non-working days. The working hours usually applies only on these given working days.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first day of the week can also be set on the Scheduler by making use of the
        <code>firstDayOfWeek</code> property, doing so which will make the Scheduler to start with that day.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note: </strong> Here, Sunday is always denoted as 0, Monday as 1 and so on.
