        In this demo, the recurrence events are defined with different repeat patterns. It can be defined through
        <code>recurrenceRule</code> field which should accept the valid rule string following the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10">
            iCalendar</a> specifications. The recurring events are differentiated from other events by a repeat marker added
        to the right-bottom of it. These events can repeat on daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.
