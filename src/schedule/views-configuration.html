        setting different start/end hour to day and week views and enabling grouping in month view. It also shows how to

        In this demo, the
        <code>views</code> property is defined to accept the array of view options and therefore for each view, it is possible
        to set different configurations. In day view, the
        <code>startHour</code> is set to 7 and
        <code>endHour</code> set to 18 whereas in week view, the same is set as 9 and 19 respectively. Also, the
        <code>showWeekend</code> property is set to false only on week view along with different timescale interval. The
        customized template is applied to the events on Agenda view and on month view, the grouping functionality is enabled
        by setting
        <code>group</code> property.
