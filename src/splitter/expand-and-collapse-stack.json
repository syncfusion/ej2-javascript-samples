With Neural Networks Using C# Succinctly by James McCaffrey, you&#x2019;ll learn \n                how to create your own neural network to solve classification problems, or problems where the outcomes can only be one of \n                several values. <br><br>Learn about encoding and normalizing data, activation functions and how to choose the right one, and ultimately \n                how to train a neural network to find weights and bias values that provide accurate predictions.\n                An artificial neural network (sometimes abbreviated ANN, or shortened to just &quot;neural network&quot; when the context is clear) is \n                a software system that loosely models biological neurons and synapses. Before explaining exactly how neural networks work, it is \n                useful to understand what types of problems they can solve.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    <div id=\"verticalSplitter\">\n            <div>\n                <div class=\"expand-content\">\n                    <a href=\"https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/data_capture_and_extraction_with_c_sharp_succinctly\" target=\"_blank\">Data Capture and Extraction with C# Succinctly</a>\n                    <p>Capturing and extracting information is one of the most important tasks a developer can perform, and making this task more\n                        engaging without relying entirely on specialized tools is an efficient way to improve productivity. \n                        In Data Capture and Extraction with C# Succinctly, author Ed Freitas guides readers toward getting more out of C# in minimal time.\n                        Email has become a pillar of our modern and connected society, and it now serves as a primary means of communication.
